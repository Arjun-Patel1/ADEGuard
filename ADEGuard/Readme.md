# 📌 Problem Statement

Monitoring adverse drug events (ADEs) is a critical task in public health and pharmacovigilance.
The VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System) dataset contains 1.2M+ reports from the last 5 years. While this data is rich, its scale introduces key challenges:

🔍 Difficulty in searching and comparing reports efficiently

📊 Complexity in identifying patterns within high-dimensional data

⚖️ Limited ability to classify event severity in a transparent, explainable way

Mini-ADEGuard addresses these challenges by transforming raw VAERS data into an interactive, searchable, and explainable web application.

## 🎯 What the Project Does

🔍 Semantic Search → retrieve similar adverse events using SBERT embeddings

📊 Dataset Exploration → preview, filter, and interact with VAERS data

🧮 Severity Modelling → baseline classification with Logistic Regression

📉 Visualization → reduce embedding dimensions with PCA for pattern discovery

🌐 Deployment → accessible via Streamlit Cloud, no setup required

⚡ For reproducibility on GitHub, this repository includes a 50k-row sample of the VAERS dataset with all models trained on it.
The original project was built on the complete 1.2M+ records.

### ⚙️ Workflow
